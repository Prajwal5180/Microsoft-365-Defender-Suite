## Lab 06 - Launch Phishing Simulation Campaigns

## Lab scenario

In this lab, we will engage in a simulated phishing attack using the Microsoft Defender portal. The objective is to launch a targeted phishing campaign, specifically focusing on credential harvesting techniques. We will navigate through the portal to configure the simulation, including selecting the payload, defining target users, assigning training, and setting up end-user notifications. The exercise culminates in the analysis of user activity and the effectiveness of the phishing simulation through the detailed reports generated by Microsoft Defender.

## Lab objectives (Duration: 40 minutes)


In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Exercise 1: Simulate a Phishing Attack

### Exercise 1: Simulate a Phishing Attack

In this we will sends fraudulent, malicious-like emails to their employees and assesses their response behavior. It helps evaluate the likelihood of each organization member falling for a phishing attack.

1. Go to Microsoft Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com.

1. Go to **Email & collaboration** > **Attack simulation training** > **Simulations** tab and Click on **Launch a Simulation**.

1. On the Name simulation page, configure the following settings:

   - **Name**: Enter a unique, descriptive name (**Credentials_Simulation**) for the simulation.
   - **Description**: Enter an optional detailed description for the simulation.
  When you're finished on the Name simulation page, select **Next**.
