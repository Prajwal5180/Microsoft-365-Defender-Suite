### Exercise 1: Create Block Lists

In this exercise, we will access the Microsoft Defender Portal to create Block Lists. By configuring these lists, we can block specific URLs, using wildcards if needed. This action enhances our organization's security posture by preventing access to URLs that pose potential security threats. The configuration allows us to control and restrict the flow of traffic, ensuring a safer environment for our network and users.

1. Go to Microsoft Defender Portal at https://security.microsoft.com/.

2. Go to **Policies & rules** and click on **Threat Policies**.

5. In the **Block URLs** flyout that opens, configure the following settings and select **Add**:
   - **Add URLs with wildcards**: loop.microsoft.com.
   - **Remove block entry after**: Select 30 days.
   - **Optional note**: The URLs listed have been blocked due to security reasons.

  >**Note**: In the Add URLs with wildcards provide one URL per line, up to a maximum of 20. For details about the syntax for URL entries, see the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/tenant-allow-block-list-urls-configure?view=o365-worldwide#url-syntax-for-the-tenant-allowblock-list

7. Back on the **URLs** tab, the entry is listed.

1. Once you configure the block URL, you can send a mail to the user using your email ID with the given link: **https://loop.microsoft.com/** in your email. You will find the mail is blocked as you did not receive it.

    >**Note**: You will have to log in to outlook with the ODL user credentials to check the mail.You can send another E-mail to ODL User without the URL link and check if the ODL user is able to receive the mail.

1. Select app launcher on the top of left hand and select outlook.

### Exercise 2: Create Allow Lists

In this exercise, we will utilize the Microsoft Defender portal to establish Allow Lists. By submitting URLs for Microsoft analysis, we enable the system to recognize and allow specific URLs that are deemed clean. This proactive approach helps in preventing false positives and ensures that legitimate URLs are not inadvertently blocked. Configuring Allow Lists is crucial for maintaining a balance between stringent security measures and allowing essential, trustworthy URLs to function seamlessly within our network.

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal, go to **Actions & submissions > Submissions** Or, go directly to the Submissions page, use [https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission](https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission)

2. On the Submissions page, select the **URLs** tab and On the **URLs** tab, select  **+Submit to Microsoft for analysis**.

3. On the **Submit to Microsoft for analysis** flyout that opens, configure the following settings and select **Submit**:
   - **Select the submission type**: URL
   - **URL**: loop.microsoft.com
   - **Why are you submitting this URL to Microsoft**: It appears clean
